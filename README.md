# IOTA Scripts

**Some useful scripts  for IOTA and Tangle operations**

Most will be in powershell, some on node.js and/or mixed between the two

As a windows user, I really love powershell and it allowed me to get started with linux without going deep in bash :-)

Coments on the script indicate if it's .Net / Windows dependent or if it's .Net core / linux compatible.

You can install powershell in linux or mac by following the instructions over at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell


List so far:

``SecureIOTASeedGenerator.ps1`` - generates as many seeds as you want, using the secure, cryptografic functions in .net
