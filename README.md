# IOTA Scripts

**Some useful scripts  for IOTA and Tangle operations**

Most will be in powershell, some on node.js and/or mixed between the two

As a windows user, I really love powershell and it allowed me to get started with linux without going deep in bash :-)

You can install powershell in linux or mac by following the instructions over at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell
